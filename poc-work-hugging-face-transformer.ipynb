We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed bytheir Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit\\nof Happiness.— \\x14That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, derivingtheir just powers from the consent of the governed,—  \\x14That whenever any Form of Government\\nbecomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to\\ninstitute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in\\nsuch form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence,indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light andtransient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to\\nsuffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which theyare accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same\\nObject evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty,\\nto throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future securit y.— \\x14Such has\\nbeen the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrainsthem to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of GreatBritain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the\\nestablishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a\\ncandid world. \\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the\\npublic good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressingimportance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained;and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of\\npeople, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in theLegislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distantfrom the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into\\ncompliance with his measures.He has dissolved Re presentative Ho uses repeatedly , for opposing wit h manly\\nfirmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be\\nelected; whereby the Leg islative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned\\nto the People at lar ge for their exe rcise; the State r emaining in the me an time\\nexposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\\nHe has endeavou red to prevent the  population of these  States; for that pur pose\\nobstructing the L aws for Natural ization of Foreig ners; refusing  to pass others to\\nencourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new\\nAppropriations of  Lands.\\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws\\nfor establishing  Judiciary pow ers.\\nHe has made Judge s dependent on his Wil l alone, for the te nure of their off ices,\\nand the amount and  payment of t heir salaries.\\nHe has erected  a multitude of New  Offices, and se nt hither swarms of  Officers to\\nharrass our people, and eat out their substance.\\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of\\nour legislature s.\\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of a nd superior to the Civil power.\\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our\\nconstitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of\\npretended Legislation:\\nFor Quartering  large bodies of  armed troops amon g us:\\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any  Murders which\\nthey should c ommit on the Inha bitants of these Sta tes:\\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\\nFor imposing Taxe s on us without our Con sent: For deprivi ng us in many  cases,\\nof the benefits of T rial by J ury:\\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended of fences\\nFor abolishing the free System of English L aws in a neighbouring Province,\\nestablishing therein an Arbitrary government, and e nlarging its Boundaries so asto render it at onc e an example and fi t instrument for intr oducing the same\\nabsolute rule into  these Colonies:\\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable L aws, and altering\\nfundamentally  the Forms of our G overnments:\\nFor suspending  our own Leg islatures, and de claring themse lves invested with\\npower to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declar ing us out of his Protection and\\nwaging War ag ainst us.\\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroy ed the\\nlives of our people.\\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat\\nthe works of death, desolation and tyranny , already begun with circumstances of\\nCruelty & pe rfidy scar cely para lleled in the most ba rbarous ages,  and totally\\nunworthy of the Head of a civilized nation.\\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear\\nArms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and\\nBrethren, or to  fall themselves by  their Hands.\\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring\\non the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known\\nrule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. \\nIn every  stage of these O ppressions We have  Petitioned for Redr ess in the most humble  terms:\\nOur repeated Pe titions have been a nswered only  by repeate d injury. A Pr ince whose char acter is\\nthus marked by every ac t which may define a Tyra nt, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. \\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from\\ntime to time  of attemp ts by th eir legi slature t o extend an  unwarra ntable jur isdiction  over us. We\\nhave reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have\\nappealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have c onjured them by the ties of our\\ncommon kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our\\nconnections and correspondence. They too have bee n deaf to the voice of justice and of\\nconsanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity , which denounces our Separation,\\nand hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. \\nWe, therefore, t he Representativ es of the united Sta tes of America, i n General Congr ess,\\nAssembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do,\\nin the Name, and by Authority of the g ood People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and\\ndeclare, That th ese United Colonie s are, and of Rig ht ought to be Fre e and Indepe ndent States;\\nthat they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that a ll political connectionbetween them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Freeand Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances,\\nestablish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of rightdo.

It is therefore, necessary that the terms and conditions of the agreement must be suitably documented in a manner that would make it clear that both parties to the contract are Ad- idem i.e., of the same mind. Ad-Idem means that both the parties understand the same thing in the same sense or are of the same mind on the same subject. There must be consensus or Ad-Idem between the parties to the contract.\nThis is possible provided all the terms and conditions, rights and duties - privileges and obligations are properly documented in terms which can be clearly interpreted in a court of law. Between two human beings sometime silence means an acceptance. But as the insurer is a legal personality entitled to contract verbal discussion between parties to the contract is not possible and hence there is a need for documentation.\nInsurance is also a contract of utmost good faith and enforced only in the distant future. It is therefore necessary that the declarations made by both the parties should be put in black and white for future reference. Any suppression, willful and material shall make the contract void. The insured, therefore, has a duty to declare all that he knows about himself, his health, his financial status in answering questions contained in the proposal form and other ancillary documents which may be required by the insurer.\nAge is an important factor in deciding the quantum of premium against a policy. The document proving the age, i.e. age proof must be reliable and the insured has to undertake as to its truthfulness.\nNon-standard age proofs are those which are comparatively less reliable and therefore the insurer accepts them with a pinch of salt. In other words the insurer takes certain precautions before accepting such age proofs as final.\nProof of income is the document may become necessary whenever the sum proposed is very high. Normally a sum proposed which is seven to eight times of the declared income is acceptable for insurance. But proposals do come to the insurer when the known source of income of the proposer is much less compared to the amount of insurance desired. A service holder normally does not face this problem as his sources of income are verifiable.\nIn case of business people, the assessed income is at times much less compared to what is a desirable income for the amount of insurance desired. In such cases the insurer at times calls for assessed income tax returns, or Chartered Accountant’s certificate etc. Such precautions are necessary to eliminate the possibility of moral hazard.\nPolicy Contract is the policy document is a detailed document and it is the Evidence of the insurance contract which mentions all the terms and conditions of the insurance. The insured buys not the policy contract, but the right to the sum of money and its future delivery. The insurer on its part promises to pay a sum of money, provided of course the insured keeps its part of promise of paying the installments of premium as scheduled.\nThe pre-amble to the insurance contract makes the above statement clear and states that this policy is issued subject to the conditions and privileges printed on the back of the policy. The endorsements placed on the policy shall also be part of the policy and it also makes a reference to the proposal form saying that that the statements given in the proposal form are the basis of the contract.\nThe schedule which is printed on the policy document identifies the office which has issued the policy. It states the name of the policyholder, the date of commencement of the policy, an identification number of the policy called policy number. This number is extremely useful for making any reference to the insurer relating to this policy. This shall avoid needless delay.\nBeneficiary’s name is also mentioned along with address.\nIt is necessary to check that it is correct and any mistake should be immediately pointed out for correction. A mistake in the address may misdirect the premium notices and any other future correspondence. It also states the name of the nominee and the date upto which premium has to be paid. The schedule goes on to mention, the type of policy, on the happening of which, the sum assured is payable and to whom it is payable. It of course also mentions when and how long the premium is to be paid.\nThe policy document is signed by an official of the insurer and dated and stamped as per the provision of the Stamp Act to make it a completely legally enforceable document.\nAn assignment of a policy in favour of another person or institution can be effected by an endorsement on the policy. Re-assignment can also be done by a subsequent endorsement on the same policy.As a nomination is automatically cancelled due to an assignment, after re-assignment, it is necessary to make a fresh nomination.\nIn Duplicate policy a policy document is a valuable document and can be used for mortgage etc. Loss of policy document does not absolve the insurer from the liability of payment of policy proceeds when the claim arises. The claim can be settled on the claimants, furnishing an indemnity bond jointly with one surety.\nIf a policy is irrevocably lost, a duplicate policy can be issued, after following a certain procedure like the insurer satisfies itself of the circumstances leading to loss and being so satisfied the insurer insists upon an advertisement in a news paper, production of an indemnity bond and payment of policy preparation charges and there after a duplicate policy is issued.\nGenerally nomination is made at the time of taking a policy. In case it is not done, it is possible to make nomination subsequently by an endorsement on the policy. It is also possible to change a nomination subsequently by an endorsement. After marriage, such change in nomination is normally required.\nLife insurance being a legally enforceable contract, needs to be documented with details of the rights and obligations of the parties to the contract. Proposal form duly filled in and signed by the proposer is the first document which forms the basis of the contract.\nEvery time, the insured pays the premium, he receives a premium receipt. The premium needs to be paid in time, non- payment of premium leads to policy-lapses. Re-instatement of the cover is called revival of the policy.\nIf the policy is not revived, the policy can become a paid up policy for a reduced sum assured under certain conditions.\nThe policy document mentions in detail all the rights and obligations of the policyholder. The agent is advised to explain the various provisions of the policy to the policyholder.\nThe wordings in the policy document are of technical nature and hence the need for explaining. If there are certain endorsements on the policy, that need to be explained too.\nIt needs to be explained that the policy is a valuable document and needs to be kept in safe custody and in the knowledge of the close relatives.\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-30T14:41:12.462211Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-30T14:41:12.462540Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-30T14:41:12.469349Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-30T14:41:12.462513Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-30T14:41:12.467959Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Perform natural language understanding tasks using a pre-trained model\nnlp = pipeline(\"question-answering\")\nsummarizer = pipeline(\"summarization\")\n\n# Extract key information and provide summarization\nsummary = summarizer(content, min_length=5, max_length=20, truncation=True)\nsummary_text = summary[0]['summary_text']\n\ncandidate_summaries = []\nwhile True:\n    user_input = input(\"What would you like to know about the document?
