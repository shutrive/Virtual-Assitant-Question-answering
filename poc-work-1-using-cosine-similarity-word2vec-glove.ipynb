It is therefore, necessary that the terms and conditions of the agreement must be suitably documented in a manner that would make it clear that both parties to the contract are Ad- idem i.e., of the same mind. Ad-Idem means that both the parties understand the same thing in the same sense or are of the same mind on the same subject. There must be consensus or Ad-Idem between the parties to the contract.\nThis is possible provided all the terms and conditions, rights and duties - privileges and obligations are properly documented in terms which can be clearly interpreted in a court of law. Between two human beings sometime silence means an acceptance. But as the insurer is a legal personality entitled to contract verbal discussion between parties to the contract is not possible and hence there is a need for documentation.\nInsurance is also a contract of utmost good faith and enforced only in the distant future. It is therefore necessary that the declarations made by both the parties should be put in black and white for future reference. Any suppression, willful and material shall make the contract void. The insured, therefore, has a duty to declare all that he knows about himself, his health, his financial status in answering questions contained in the proposal form and other ancillary documents which may be required by the insurer.\nAge is an important factor in deciding the quantum of premium against a policy. The document proving the age, i.e. age proof must be reliable and the insured has to undertake as to its truthfulness.\nNon-standard age proofs are those which are comparatively less reliable and therefore the insurer accepts them with a pinch of salt. In other words the insurer takes certain precautions before accepting such age proofs as final.\nProof of income is the document may become necessary whenever the sum proposed is very high. Normally a sum proposed which is seven to eight times of the declared income is acceptable for insurance. But proposals do come to the insurer when the known source of income of the proposer is much less compared to the amount of insurance desired. A service holder normally does not face this problem as his sources of income are verifiable.\nIn case of business people, the assessed income is at times much less compared to what is a desirable income for the amount of insurance desired. In such cases the insurer at times calls for assessed income tax returns, or Chartered Accountant’s certificate etc. Such precautions are necessary to eliminate the possibility of moral hazard.\nPolicy Contract is the policy document is a detailed document and it is the Evidence of the insurance contract which mentions all the terms and conditions of the insurance. The insured buys not the policy contract, but the right to the sum of money and its future delivery. The insurer on its part promises to pay a sum of money, provided of course the insured keeps its part of promise of paying the installments of premium as scheduled.\nThe pre-amble to the insurance contract makes the above statement clear and states that this policy is issued subject to the conditions and privileges printed on the back of the policy. The endorsements placed on the policy shall also be part of the policy and it also makes a reference to the proposal form saying that that the statements given in the proposal form are the basis of the contract.\nThe schedule which is printed on the policy document identifies the office which has issued the policy. It states the name of the policyholder, the date of commencement of the policy, an identification number of the policy called policy number. This number is extremely useful for making any reference to the insurer relating to this policy. This shall avoid needless delay.\nBeneficiary’s name is also mentioned along with address.\nIt is necessary to check that it is correct and any mistake should be immediately pointed out for correction. A mistake in the address may misdirect the premium notices and any other future correspondence. It also states the name of the nominee and the date upto which premium has to be paid. The schedule goes on to mention, the type of policy, on the happening of which, the sum assured is payable and to whom it is payable. It of course also mentions when and how long the premium is to be paid.\nThe policy document is signed by an official of the insurer and dated and stamped as per the provision of the Stamp Act to make it a completely legally enforceable document.\nAn assignment of a policy in favour of another person or institution can be effected by an endorsement on the policy. Re-assignment can also be done by a subsequent endorsement on the same policy.As a nomination is automatically cancelled due to an assignment, after re-assignment, it is necessary to make a fresh nomination.\nIn Duplicate policy a policy document is a valuable document and can be used for mortgage etc. Loss of policy document does not absolve the insurer from the liability of payment of policy proceeds when the claim arises. The claim can be settled on the claimants, furnishing an indemnity bond jointly with one surety.\nIf a policy is irrevocably lost, a duplicate policy can be issued, after following a certain procedure like the insurer satisfies itself of the circumstances leading to loss and being so satisfied the insurer insists upon an advertisement in a news paper, production of an indemnity bond and payment of policy preparation charges and there after a duplicate policy is issued.\nGenerally nomination is made at the time of taking a policy. In case it is not done, it is possible to make nomination subsequently by an endorsement on the policy. It is also possible to change a nomination subsequently by an endorsement. After marriage, such change in nomination is normally required.\nLife insurance being a legally enforceable contract, needs to be documented with details of the rights and obligations of the parties to the contract. Proposal form duly filled in and signed by the proposer is the first document which forms the basis of the contract.\nEvery time, the insured pays the premium, he receives a premium receipt. The premium needs to be paid in time, non- payment of premium leads to policy-lapses. Re-instatement of the cover is called revival of the policy.\nIf the policy is not revived, the policy can become a paid up policy for a reduced sum assured under certain conditions.\nThe policy document mentions in detail all the rights and obligations of the policyholder. The agent is advised to explain the various provisions of the policy to the policyholder.\nThe wordings in the policy document are of technical nature and hence the need for explaining. If there are certain endorsements on the policy, that need to be explained too.\nIt needs to be explained that the policy is a valuable document and needs to be kept in safe custody and in the knowledge of the close relatives.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport nltk\nnltk.download('punkt')\ntokens = nltk.sent_tokenize(pdf_txt)\nfor t in tokens:\n    print(t, \"\\n\")\n

Embedding","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is a word embedding technique used in natural language processing to represent words as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space.\n\nGloVe differs from other word embedding methods, like Word2Vec, in how it constructs word vectors. Instead of solely relying on local context (neighboring words), GloVe leverages global statistical information from a large corpus of text.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation of how GloVe works:\n\n* GloVe starts by creating a co-occurrence matrix that captures how frequently words co-occur with each other in the given text corpus.\n* It then applies matrix factorization techniques to this co-occurrence matrix. The goal is to factorize the matrix into two smaller matrices, such that their product approximates the original co-occurrence matrix.\n* The resulting factorized matrices are used to compute word vectors. Each word is represented by a vector in the high-dimensional space, where the dimensions capture the relationships between words based on their co-occurrence patterns.\n* By training on a large corpus, GloVe learns to capture both the global context (how words relate to each other across the entire corpus) and the local context (how words relate to their neighboring words).\n* The learned word vectors can be used in various natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.\n\n### GloVe embeddings have several advantages. They tend to capture semantic relationships between words, such as analogies (e.g., \"king\" - \"man\" + \"woman\" ≈ \"queen\"). Additionally, they are less sensitive to word frequency and work well even with rare words.\n\nOverall, GloVe provides a powerful way to represent words as vectors by leveraging global statistical information from a corpus, enabling computers to understand and work with language more effectively.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import gensim.downloader as api\n\nglove_model

Fine tuned Bert Technique","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\n\nInstead of looking at words in isolation, BERT, a transformer based model attempts to use the context of words to get embeddings. BERT uses several concepts of deep learning come up with a model that looks at context in a bidirectional fashion, leveraging information from the entire sentences as a whole through self-attention.\n\nExample: Suppose Question is \"How I can cross a road when their is no zebra crossing.\" and this question very similar to query \"How I can cross road on zebra crossing.\" and thier is a chance that above two method give wrong answers but could handle that question. And we don't remove stoping words in the document because if it remove word like in above example \"no\" meaning of whole sentance become change. Bert uses stoping words to make relations between words.\n\nWhat is Model Fine-Tuning?\n\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a big neural network architecture, with a huge number of parameters, that can range from 100 million to over 300 million. So, training a BERT model from scratch on a small dataset would result in overfitting.\n\nSo, it is better to use a pre-trained BERT model that was trained on a huge dataset, as a starting point. We can then further train the model on our relatively smaller dataset and this process is known as model fine-tuning.\n\nInstalling the Hugging Face
